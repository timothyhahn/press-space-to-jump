# Press Space To Jump

Little game I made in Python and pygame.

Came up with a dumb fake ECS system since Python seems to have no good ECS libraries.

## Installing Dependencies

* You need virtualenv and pip already installed
* Probably need SDL too, not sure.
* `virtualenv venv`
* `source `
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

* `python pressspacetojump.py`
